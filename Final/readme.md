# 期末作業

## 習題 1: 請為下列編譯器加上 do while 迴圈的處理程式
    Expanded significantly with AI-assisted guidance to implement support for additional control flow constructs such as do-while and for loops. 
[習題 1](https://github.com/julianalidya/_sp/blob/main/HW%201/compiler.c)

## 習題 2: c4 組合語言理解與硬塞練習
    I use teacher's 參考 file as reference. ChatGPT helped me to extend and test to implement a recursive power function and integrate debugging output for instruction tracing.
